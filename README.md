# Flash-Card-Maker
A simple python program for creating flash card sets and studying them. I created this initially just to study for my Japanese class, but decided to keep adding onto it as I thought of new features that could be useful.

# Future To-Dos
- Add a quiz mode where you have to type the answer and it gives you feedback after each question
- Add a way to add folders for related cards sets
- Add a test mode similar to the quiz mode but answers aren't revealed until the end
