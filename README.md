# Flash-Card-Maker
A simple python program for creating flash card sets and studying them. I created this initially just to study for my Japanese class (after Quizlet's sharp decline in GOATness), but decided to keep adding onto it as I thought of new features that could be useful.

# Current Features
- Create and edit card sets
- Practice in flashcard mode by loading sets
- Quiz on flashcard sets

# Future To-Dos
- Add point system and question tracking to quiz mode
- Add a way to create folders for related cards sets
- Add a way to open a specific folder when loading
